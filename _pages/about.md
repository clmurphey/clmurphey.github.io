Hi! I am a Ph.D. Student in Computer Science at the University of Colorado--Boulder. My advisors are [Liz Bradley](https://home.cs.colorado.edu/~lizb/) and [Jed Brown](https://jedbrown.org/). My doctoral work involves simulating the physics involved in speech (or “phonation”). Specifically, my research aims to understand the mechanisms that drive phonation and generate aerosol particles involved in the transmission of pathogens.

In a semi-recent past life, I worked as a mechanical engineer and registered U.S. patent agent. Specializing in thermodynamics, fluid dynamics, and manufacturing, I wrote and prosecuted over 100 patent applications on a broad range of hardware and software technologies. Some of my other projects include numerous computational models simulating biomechanical growth and remodeling, cardiac electrical pacing, combustion engines, and cogeneration plants.

In my free time, I am an active church and choral musician, open water swimmer, amateur photographer (see [Projects]({% link _pages/projects.md %})), and proud Golden Retriever parent.
