  abstract  = {Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) through biventricular stimulation was first used in the early 1990s as a treatment option for patients with systolic heart failure, intraventricular conduction delay, and other cardiac arrhythmias [1]. CRT, also known as biventricular pacing (BiVP), is an alternative to right ventricular stimulation, which induces dyssynchronous ventricular contraction. In BiVP, three pacing leads are usually placed on the myocardium of the right atrium, the right ventricle, and the left ventricle in the distal cardiac vein. Because there are no standardized loci for lead placement in BiVP, physicians rely on trial and error when inserting pacemaker leads and use electrocardiograms (ECG) to determine the effectiveness of the BiVP lead placement. The ECG measures the electrical conduction, contraction pacing, and projections of the anatomy of the myocardium. Abnormalities in the sinusoidal waves of the ECG reveal problems. Therefore, the ECG can depict a quantitative representation of the effectiveness of biventricular pacing lead placement.},

  abstract  = {Human phonation induces the formation and ejection of aerosols from the mouth. In infectious speakers, phonation- induced aerosolization can facilitate the transmission of airborne viruses. However, the formation of such aerosols is challenging to study experimentally due to the complex structure of the larynx, the inability to directly measure aerosol generation at the laryngeal level, and the length scale at which fluid atomization occurs. To gain insight into these complicated dynamics, we have developed a computational framework that models the ejection, motion, and subsequent breakup of sessile liquid originating on the surface of the vocal folds. Much like Robert Shaw's classic dripping faucet system, droplets ejecting from a vibrating elastic surface can be modeled as a damped simple harmonic oscillator with nonlinear springs and dampers in which mass is ejected with each oscillation. The framework proposed here combines a droplet-ejection model that is based on a Rayleigh-Taylor instability with a model of nonlinear vibrational elastodynamics induced by fluid-structure interaction between exhaled air and the vocal fold tissues. Its output yields a spray distribution that we can compare to experimental aerosol size distributions collected during laryngeal phonation.},
