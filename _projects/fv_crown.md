  <p>As an elastic band vibrates, a sessile fluid (sugar-free blue Powerade) on top of that band ejects upward forming a crown of fluid jets. These jets eventually impinge and form droplets.</p>

    <p>Camera information: Shot on an Olympus OM-D E-M10 Mark II with the kit lens at 42mm, an f number of f/5.6, exposure time of 1/10,000, and 1600 ISO using the Shutter priority program. The fluid (Blue Powerade Zero) was dispensed on top of a black elastic exercise band extended between two legs of a chair. This photo was taken outside in direct sunlight. I augmented the lighting with a shop halogen lamp directed toward the band from the opposite side of the sun.</p>
