    <p>A water droplet bounces off of the surface of a liquid pool and the impact generates a jet and radiating ripples. The jet is also called a Worthington jet. Jets refer to the ligament of fluid that extends normal to the water surface. This image also captures the beginning of jet “pinch-off,” where the upper portion of the Worthington jet bifurcates from the lower portion of the jet to form another droplet.</p>

    <p>This image was shot on an Olympus E-M10 Mark II camera with the following settings: Focal length: 42 mm, Aperture: f/5.6, Shutter Speed: 1/1000, and ISO 500 with 600 lumen flashlight.</p>
