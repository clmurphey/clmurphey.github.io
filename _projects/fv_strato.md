      <p>A stratocumulus radiatus roll forms above the trees below some cirrus undulatus or cirrus fibratus wisps at the top of the image. Captured in Niwot, CO while facing southwest, these clouds formed in a stable atmosphere (CAPE = 0) at around 3000 â€“ 4000m altitude. The wind was coming from the Northwest at around 15 knots.</p>
